# AdageDataModel

## Introduction
Welcome to the `AdageDataModel` repository, which is primarily composed of Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks offer interactive data model code examples that are part of the research initiatives at the Faculty of Art and Design (FAIC) and are also utilized for instructional purposes in the SENG3011 course at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).

## Content
The notebooks within this repository encapsulate data models that are essential for understanding complex relationships in research datasets and provide hands-on experience for students in software engineering.

## Research Integration
The `AdageDataModel` is integral to ongoing research projects within the FAIC. It encapsulates key structures and relationships that are critical to the analysis and interpretation of research data.

## Educational Use
For students enrolled in SENG3011, this repository provides practical examples of data modeling in a real-world context. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in software engineering.

## Using the Notebooks
To use the Colab notebooks:

1. Navigate to the desired `.ipynb` file within the repository.
2. Click on the file to open the notebook preview.
3. Select the "Open in Colab" button to run the notebook in Google Colab.

Make sure you have a Google account to save a copy of the notebook to your drive if you wish to retain your modifications.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions to improve the existing notebooks or to add new ones that support the FAIC research and SENG3011 teaching objectives. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
